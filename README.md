# Bengaluru Traffic Data Analysis 
## Overview
This project analyzes traffic data for the city of Bengaluru using Power BI. The analysis provides insights into various aspects of traffic flow, congestion, and accident hotspots, which can help urban planners and policymakers make data-driven decisions to improve road safety and traffic management.

## Key Features
Interactive Dashboards: Visualize traffic patterns and hotspots.
Data Analysis: Focus on accident frequency, peak traffic hours, and congestion.
Predictive Analytics: Forecasting traffic trends for better infrastructure planning.

## process
Data Collection: Gather traffic, accident, and road infrastructure data from sources like HiHub, GPS systems, and government portals.

Data Cleaning: Preprocess data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring timestamp consistency.

Data Modeling: Create relationships between datasets (e.g., location, time) and define calculated measures like congestion index or accident frequency.

Visualization: Design Power BI dashboards with heatmaps, line charts, and bar graphs for accident hotspots, peak traffic hours, and travel time.

Predictive Analytics: Use historical data to forecast traffic patterns and predict accident-prone areas.
